      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>Sabor was the wise patriarch whose name now echoes in every hill and heart in our community. Married to Anam, he believed the greatest wealth was family — love, unity, and legacy. Together they raised <strong>thirteen children</strong>, each carrying values of strength, wisdom, and kindness.</p>

      <p>The eldest, <strong>Onduru Sabor</strong>, named after his grandfather, stood out as a leader. With brothers like <strong>Okombo</strong>, Onduru shared and cared for the land inherited from Sabor. From that inheritance came not just land but the legacy we honor today: the Sabor Family.</p>

      <h3>Mission</h3>
      <p>To bring together all Saborians in building a united family that values love, peace, and mutual support — ensuring no one is left behind.</p>

      <h3>Vision</h3>
      <p>To see every Saborian successful, united, and empowered within ten years — flourishing in education, relationships, and communal harmony.</p>

      <h3>Our Values</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Education & Excellence</strong> — We honour learning, celebrate achievement, and support every child's journey to shine.</li>
        <li><strong>Unity & Brotherhood</strong> — As Onduru and Okombo taught, we are strongest together.</li>
        <li><strong>Respect & Heritage</strong> — We preserve our stories, mother tongue, land, and memories of our forebears.</li>
        <li><strong>Love & Peace</strong> — Love binds us; peace guides how we live and treat each other.</li>
      </ul>
